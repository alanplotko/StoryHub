- Encourages NaNoWriMo
- Focused on stories, but can expand to anything (e.g. taking notes in class, jotting down ideas)
- Loading messages: "Logging in with GitHub...", "Fetching stories..."
- Create and link GitHub Account -> send form details to GitHub registration link or load GitHub registration page within the window, creates configuration file "config.storyhub" in JSON with username, does not save password, must enter each time you run the app
- Add other options for saving online

GitHub Translation:

- Edit Story -> Focus on directory
- Create New Chapter -> Add new markdown file locally
- Add & Modify Notes -> notes.storyhub file created by default and is blank. Add JSON file for chapter description and notes to pull and push into GitHub and to integrate into the interface
- Save Chapter -> Save file locally
- Backup Chapter -> Git Add Filename & Commit & Push
- Backup Book -> Git Add - A & Commit & Push
- If quit, ask to save current file
- Backup book before quit
