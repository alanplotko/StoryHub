## About StoryHub

StoryHub is your story's home. StoryHub enables the user to write their stories within the desktop application and back them up to GitHub. It organizes the author's stories for them, so they don't have to. Authors can focus on their stories alone and leave the rest to StoryHub.

I developed StoryHub so that younger writers can easily adjust to starting their first story. You shouldn't be discouraged from writing because the software is too expensive or overwhelming. StoryHub will be free (open-source) to use and will continue to improve to suit the needs of writers. However, it shouldn't be limited to just stories. You can use it to take notes in class or manage other types of texts beyond stories. StoryHub's primary objective may be to assist writers in crafting stories, but can go far beyond that. I want to redesign the interface and work on adding new features and improvements.
